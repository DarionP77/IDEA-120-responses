A Gesamtkuntwerk basically is described as a “total work of art”. Gesamtkuntwerk explores more about combining other works of art into one. This can be from music,  to other visual arts like paintings, and sculpting. In addition to those forms of artwork works that can come together with a proud art that is often used in making Gesamtkunstwerk are theaters and operas. It was necessary to combine these works of art with something like theater and opera because it tested the audience skills in detecting the different artworks, and engages their sensory skill. 
	Some of the applications that were used in Gesamtkunstwerk were the use of Visual Art softwares like Adobe to gain access to 2D and 3D artworks for their audience. Another tool that was used more physically than digitally would be machines like 3D printers, CND machines, or laser cutters. SOne final thing that caught my attention was their usage of Sensory Technologies, specifically the biofeedback sensors that layout the whole environment in real time, but that's not even the interesting part. It's how this sensory experience can be used to gauge audience interaction with the artwork itself.
