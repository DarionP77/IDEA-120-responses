Something like Van Gogh “Starry Night”
This would be seen very differently if it was in a different medium because of a variety of factors. But notably, something like this has been transferred to different scenes of media like parodies. 
In addition something like this is even different by it being either a digital or physical copy that acts as another medium for audiences to give their opinions on because they are now interacting with it . 
Finally if you tried to envision Van Gogh's”Starry Night” into something like a book instead of its original painted canvas version then it would seem different because of the materials used on a canvas versus traditional book pages.
