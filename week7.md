Week 7 Repository

What I want to do for my Green Screen Project is probaby do a wrap or teleport idea where I travel to different distatious environments trying to get away from a crazy ex or something. I want the concept to be like me logging on about to greet you and then out of no where the ex walks in the room where I would press something to wrap me to a different location each time with her
